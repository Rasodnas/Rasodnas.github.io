                      	Raffaello Chiarioni (Città di Castello, may 1st 1996) is an italian graphic designer. 
			He finds out about graphic design in his teenages, and began designing small visual identities for cultural events, establishing a strong relationship with the artist community of his hometown. 
			He decides to further his path at the Nuovo Istituto di Design di Perugia in 2017, to then land at Politecnico di Milano, where in 2020 he graduates in Communication Design with a thesis in Editorial Design, under the supervision of prof. Mario Piazza.
			He began his freelance career in parallel with his studies, designing books, catalogues and visual identities for museums such as Fondazione Burri (La Luce del Nero, 2022), Santa Maria della Scala di Siena and Istituto dei Ciechi di Milano (VIBE – Voyage Inside a Blind Experience, 2018), Galleria dell’Accademia di Firenze and cultural institutions such as PerSo Film Festival (Lo spazio che occupo, 2020), TSU – Teatro Stabile dell’Umbria (Otello, 2022 – Dramagia, 2022 – Diario di uno spettatore clandestino, 2021), Emergenze Publishing and elèuthera editrice (Lezioni di Anarchia vol.1 / 2), collaborating and working for authors such as Andrea Baracco, Antonio Brizioli, Goffredo Fofi, Beppe Giacobbe, François Olislaeger, Paolo Ventura.
			Since 2018, he collaborates with Edicola 518 and its independent publishing house Emergenze Publishing, by giving visual form to many of the italian art collective’s editorial and artistic endeavours.
			Since April 3 2023 the editorial project Lezioni di Anarchia, curated by Emergenze Publishing and elèuthera editrice, which Raffaello translated in book form, is in show at ADI Design Museum in Milan, on its latest exhibition ITALY: A New Collective Landscape, which aims to highlight the state of today’s young Italian design scene by collecting projects born from collaborative practices.

                Approach <br><br>
                I istinctively try to digest complexity until what's left is capable of being universally understandable. I find a rare, silent beauty in all art where nothing more is present than what is needed. I am a firm thinker of graphic design as a bridge between people and ideas, generating artifacts capable of conveying people's attention without demanding it.

                        This handcrafted repository is both a place for you to consult my work, as well as a place for me to keep track of what I've done and reason on what I'd like to do next.
							          The site is still updating but, while I'm working on uploading more images and projects, the first dozen should be enough for you to understand my visual and conceptual approach to the discipline.
